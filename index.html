                    <div class="modal-body">
                      Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella.
                      She lived with her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters. They
                      treated Cinderella very badly. One day, they were invited for a
                      grand ball in the king’s palace. But Cinderella’s stepmother
                      would not let her go. Cinderella was made to sew new party
                      gowns for her stepmother and stepsisters, and curl their hair.
                      They then went to the ball, leaving Cinderella alone at home.
                      <br><br>
                      Cinderella felt very sad and began to cry. Suddenly, a fairy
                      godmother appeared and said, “Don’t cry, Cinderella! I will
                      send you to the ball!” But Cinderella was sad. She said, “I
                      don’t have a gown to wear for the ball!” The fairy godmother
                      waved her magic wand and changed Cinderella’s old clothes into
                      a beautiful new gown! The fairy godmother then touched Cinderella’s
                      feet with the magic wand. And lo! She had beautiful glass slippers!
                      “How will I go to the grand ball?” asked Cinderella. The fairy
                      godmother found six mice playing near a pumpkin, in the kitchen.
                      She touched them with her magic wand and the mice became four shiny
                      black horses and two coachmen and the pumpkin turned into a golden
                      coach. Cinderella was overjoyed and set off for the ball in the coach
                      drawn by the six black horses. Before leaving. the fairy godmother
                      said, “Cinderella, this magic will only last until midnight!
                      You must reach home by then!”
                      <br><br>
                      When Cinderella entered the palace, everybody was struck by
                      her beauty. Nobody, not even Cinderella’s stepmother or stepsisters,
                      knew who she really was in her pretty clothes and shoes.
                      The handsome prince also saw her and fell in love with Cinderella.
                      He went to her and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And Cinderella
                      said, “Yes!” The prince danced with her all night and nobody
                      recognized the beautiful dancer. Cinderella was so happy dancing
                      with the prince that she almost forgot what the fairy godmother
                      had said. At the last moment, Cinderella remembered her fairy
                      godmother’s words and she rushed to go home. “Oh! I must go!”
                      she cried and ran out of the palace. One of her glass slippers
                      came off but Cinderella did not turn back for it. She reached
                      home just as the clock struck twelve. Her coach turned back into
                      a pumpkin, the horses into mice and her fine ball gown into
                      rags. Her stepmother and stepsisters reached home shortly after
                      that. They were talking about the beautiful lady who had been
                      dancing with the prince.
                      <br><br>
                      The prince had fallen in love with Cinderella and wanted to find
                      out who the beautiful girl was, but he did not even know her name.
                      He found the glass slipper that had come off Cinderella’s foot
                      as she ran home. The prince said, “I will find her. The lady
                      whose foot fits this slipper will be the one I marry!” The next
                      day, the prince and his servants took the glass slipper and
                      went to all the houses in the kingdom. They wanted to find
                      the lady whose feet would fit in the slipper. All the women
                      in the kingdom tried the slipper but it would not fit any
                      of them. Cinderella’s stepsisters also tried on the little
                      glass slipper. They tried to squeeze their feet and push
                      hard into the slipper, but the servant was afraid the slipper
                      would break. Cinderella’s stepmother would not let her try
                      the slipper on, but the prince saw her and said, “Let her
                      also try on the slipper!” The slipper fit her perfectly.
                      The prince recognized her from the ball. He married Cinderella
                      and together they lived happily ever after.

                      One day, Little Red Riding Hood’s mother said to her, “Take
                      this basket of goodies to your grandma’s cottage, but don’t
                      talk to strangers on the way!” Promising not to, Little Red
                      Riding Hood skipped off. On her way she met the Big Bad Wolf
                      who asked, “Where are you going, little girl?” “To my grandma’s,
                      Mr. Wolf!” she answered.
                      <br><br>
                      The Big Bad Wolf then ran to her grandmother’s cottage much
                      before Little Red Riding Hood, and knocked on the door. When
                      Grandma opened the door, he locked her up in the cupboard.
                      The wicked wolf then wore Grandma’s clothes and lay on her
                      bed, waiting for Little Red Riding Hood.
                      <br><br>
                      When Little Red Riding Hood reached the cottage, she entered
                      and went to Grandma’s bedside. “My! What big eyes you have,
                      Grandma!” she said in surprise. “All the better to see you
                      with, my dear!” replied the wolf. “My! What big ears you have,
                      Grandma!” said Little Red Riding Hood. “All the better to
                      hear you with, my dear!” said the wolf. “What big teeth you
                      have, Grandma!” said Little Red Riding Hood. “All the better
                      to eat you with!” growled the wolf pouncing on her. Little
                      Red Riding Hood screamed and the woodcutters in the forest
                      came running to the cottage. They beat the Big Bad Wolf and
                      rescued Grandma from the cupboard. Grandma hugged Little
                      Red Riding Hood with joy. The Big Bad Wolf ran away never
                      to be seen again. Little Red Riding Hood had learnt her
                      lesson and never spoke to strangers ever again.

                      A little old man and a little old woman stayed in a cottage.
                      <br><br>
                      One day, the woman made a gingerbread man for dinner. She
                      decorated the gingerbread man with eyes made of currants and
                      buttons made of cherries. But when she took out gingerbread
                      man from the oven, he jumped out and ran away.
                      <br><br>
                      The old woman and her husband ran after him but gingerbread
                      man was too fast for them. Neither the pig, nor the cow, nor
                      the horse who followed, could outrun gingerbread man. Now,
                      the gingerbread man came to a river and didn’t know how to
                      cross it. A sly fox came up to him and offered to help him
                      to cross the river. He asked him to sit on his tail but
                      gingerbread man began to get wet. Then the fox told him to
                      sit on his back and finally on his nose.
                      <br><br>
                      No sooner did gingerbread man sit on the fox’s nose, that
                      the sly fox tossed him and gobbled him up.

                    <div class="modal-body">
                      There were three bears who lived in the woods. There was a big
                      bear, medium bear, and a wee bear. One day when they left their
                      house, a little girl named Goldilocks walked into their house.
                      The bears had made porridge.
                      <br><br>
                      Goldilocks tried the big bear's porridge but it was too hot;
                      she then tried the medium bear's porridge but it was too cold.
                      Then she tried the wee bear's porridge and it was just right,
                      so she ate it all. Then, she sat in all of their chairs.
                      The big bear's chair was too hard, the medium bear's chair
                      was too soft, but the wee bear's chair was just right so she
                      sat there until the bottom came out.
                      <br><br>
                      Goldilocks felt tired so she went to big bear's bed but it was
                      too high at the head, the medium bear's bed was too high at the
                      feet, but the wee bear's bed was just right so she fell asleep
                      there. The bears returned home and realized someone had eaten
                      some of their porridge (and all of wee bear's), sat in all of
                      their chairs (and broke the bottom out of wee bear's), and
                      lied in all of their beds (and was still in wee bear's).
                      <br><br>
                      Goldilocks did not hear the big bear's voice because it
                      sounded like thunder, the medium bear's voice sounded
                      like a dream, but the wee bear's shrill voice woke Goldilocks
                      up and she saw the three bears sitting on the edge of her bed
                      and ran out the window. The bears never saw Goldilocks again.

                      There lived three billy goats who decided to climb a mountain
                      to chew grass. But a wooden bridge had to be crossed to reach
                      the mountain. Underneath it lived a one-eyed troll (giant),
                      who ate up all those who tried to cross the bridge.
                      <br><br>
                      The smallest Billy Goat Gruff, (for that was their name), went
                      first. As he stepped on the bridge, the troll shouted, “Who
                      goes there across my bridge?”
                      <br><br>
                      “I am the smallest Billy Goat Gruff,” came the reply.
                      <br><br>
                      “I shall eat you up,” roared the troll.
                      <br><br>
                      “Please wait, for a bigger goat is on its way,” said the small
                      Billy Goat Gruff. The greedy troll decided to let him go.
                      <br><br>
                      The second billy goat also told the troll the samething and
                      crossed the bridge. On seeing the third billy goat, the troll
                      pounced on him. But the goat was big and he knocked the troll
                      down with his huge horns and killed it.

                    <div class="modal-body">
                      Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack.
                      One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack
                      went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to
                      buy his cow. Jack asked, “What will you give me in return for
                      my cow?” The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!”
                      Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when
                      he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, “You
                      fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!” She
                      threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and
                      went to sleep without dinner.
                      <br><br>
                      The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out
                      of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his
                      magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom
                      in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside
                      the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said,
                      “Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!”
                      The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.
                      <br><br>
                      While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very
                      big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went and
                      hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood
                      of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his
                      bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!”
                      So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. He took out
                      his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he
                      went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place,
                      took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home,
                      he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and
                      they lived well for sometime.
                      <br><br>
                      climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s house again. Once
                      again, Jack asked the giant’s wife for food, but while he was
                      eating the giant returned. Jack leapt up in fright and went and
                      hid under the bed. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the
                      blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind
                      his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy
                      in here!” The giant ate his food and went to his room. There,
                      he took out a hen. He shouted, “Lay!” and the hen laid a golden
                      egg. When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed
                      down the beanstalk. Jack’s mother was very happy with him.
                      <br><br>
                      After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to
                      the giant’s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife
                      and asked for some food. Once again, the giant’s wife gave him
                      bread and milk. But while Jack was eating, the giant came home.
                      “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive,
                      or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” cried
                      the giant. “Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!” said his wife.
                      <br><br>
                      The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While
                      the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly,
                      the magic harp cried, “Help master! A boy is stealing me!” The giant
                      woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But
                      Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home.
                      The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and
                      fetched an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died.
                      <br><br>
                      Jack and his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.
